// Fixes and updates ASAP
* Show difficulty number appropriately (Network Stats)
+ Fix callback (execute function after getting API data, instead of setting time delay)
+ Replace API to get last block number (get netwrok last block, not last block mined by pool)
+ Extract difficulty from last network block (use etherscan.io, nanopool might have same thing if block requested by number)
+ Hyperlink wallets to blockchain explorer
* Make hyperlinks open a new tab
* CSS on hyperlinks


// Overall
* Get Claymore API
* Get difficulty and prices graphs
* Set variabiles (addresses, pool(s), coins) to load from different, more user friendly files (separate config file)
* Calculate transaction fees (gas and gwei price)

// Long Run
* Show Claymore API
* Show Aprrox earnings based on hashrate for coins, independent from Pool stats (Approx Earnings is using nanopool calculator API)
	Claymore's API, Approx earnings for both (or more) coins always visble, then select coin to view mining stats from pool
	Note: Stats from pool colud include graphs
* Overall Design and CSS
* Hamburger side menu with options to set API's and other variabiles
	ex. Add more wallets to watch (dynamic wallets table), different coins too
* Calculate most profitable coin to mine
* Responsive mobile page
* Dynamic table for Crypto to Crypto exchange

// Maybe one day
* Add different pool API's
* Add different miner API's
* Integrate shapeshift.io (exchange coins directly without going to shapeshift)
* If it grows so much it needs server:
	Make use of databases
	Make TCP/IP raw request for miner API without need for monitor server on rig
* Mining page for mutiple rigs, showing stats for each rig
